  [ Leonidas Loucas ]
  * New post flag in Multiget. "compact" :: Bool , defaults to false.  Multiget responses can potentially contain many counters with many buckets. Without compact each bucket is a jsonObject mapping keys (time,count,min,max,avg,sum,sumsq,sdev) to their valuesm which are numeric. If "compact":true is passed in the json request, each bucket will be a jsonArray of just the numeric values ordered [time,count,min,max,sum,sumsq,avg,sdev]. This makes compact requests harder to visually/programitically parse (less simple than just asking for the keys) but reduces the size of the response when requesting many counters.

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * Fixed a bug where bucket maxes were being recorded as bucket count
    in most cases, due to consuming the wrong command argument in the
    seven-argument record message (used when forwarding). Additionally,
    we now validate data being sent to istatd and reject completely
    bogus samples (min > max, or count = 0, or sum/count outside of
    [min, max]). Each rejection is tracked in a loopback counter for
    later examination.
  * Changed references to <time.h>'s time(0) to use istattime(0)
    instead, for consistency.
  * Fixed test_StatServer so it will no longer intermittently fail when
    time is a multiple of 10 seconds. Have all test failures go through
    the same function, to aid in debugging (exit(1) tends to be caught
    too late). Also, conditionally allow test failure to throw an
    exception so it is even easier to setup a breakpoint in gdb (just
    'catch throw').
  * Fixed a quirk in how times for collated buckets were recorded which
    was throwing the web frontend for a loop. It now rounds down
    timestamps to the nearest multiple of the collationInterval_ in
    StatCounter.

istatd (0.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mitch Nibbelink ]
  * Fix bug in graphing where refresh did not work as expected

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * Fixed a small bug in the refresh code
  * Document the funky behaviour of istatd's collated counters in a C++-
    side acceptance test in test_StatCounter.cpp. The eventually desired
    behaviour is commented out.

  [ Mitch Nibbelink ]
  * Fix up circular references which caused istatd to leak
    EagerConnection references and bloat after tcp stats were sent.
    Check in perl code to replicate the problem.  No actual tests
    written to replicate the problem since it required manual valgrind
    analysis
  * graph tweaks to improve range setting as well as human readable
    range tags
  * Allow bare words to be auto wildcarded in search so af002013 becomes
    *af002013* automatically

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * Massive rewrite of the counter system to handle collation correctly,
    and with tolerance to latency and clock skew.

  [ acrowell-imvu ]
  * Remove unnecessary initialization step -- default constructors must
    be run anyways, and do the exact same thing that loop does. (Not
    compiled, but inferred by review)
  * Why are we throwing an exception on the heap? That is probably a
    mistake. (Not compiled, trivial change)
  * Dangling semi-colon, probably from deleted code sometime.

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * Check for power-of-two in Statcounter record was of form (a & (a -
    1)) instead of ((a & (a - 1)) == 0), meaning it would've been
    updating every non-power-of-two before. Fixed.
  * Minor clarity edits (more descriptive naming, removing unnecessary
    comments, fixing some logging, function signature changes) after
    some review to the istatd counter-collation change. Additionally,
    removed the variable isCollated_ from the otherwise purely abstract
    IStatCounter class in favor of a predicate function isCollated().

istatd (0.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Zooming of graphs now fetches higher resolution data. Built off the
    work that Jon S. started, but with a bunch of extra tricks (using
    new Dygraph features that are undocumented but have examples)
    involved to get Dygraphs to work with 1) multiple graphs. 2)
    restoring zoom to 'original' intervals when double-clicking. 3)
    allow y zooming, without having to reload datasets.

  * Fix up some error messaging on date range selection
  * Add ability to change graphs via crossreference to the edit button

  [ Curtis Pullen ]
  * Interface upgrade: single-leaf branches like a->b->c get collapsed
    into single leaf nodes like a.b.c

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * Added preliminary CSV format support to the web interface. The GET
    handler for generating counter data now takes an optional format
    parameter, which can be either '&format=json' (the default) or
    '&format=csv'

  [ Curtis Pullen ]
  * add interface branches for counter names with underscores and dashes

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * Fixed graphs to not expand for error bars, and instead use the
    minimum and maximum of the plot data points
  * Expand graph ranges to fit positive standard deviation error bar.
  * Add 'plain-text: nowrap' rules to counter tree and dashboard list so
    that labels don't wrap lines when there are hyphens in them.

  [ Mitch Nibbelink ]
  * INFRA-1862 address security issue where istat would always bind to
    all interfaces when listening.  Now have optional --listen-address
    1.2.3.4 style arguments as well.  Added functional tests for it as
    well

  [ Curtis Pullen ]
  * istatd init script now properly waits for istatd to stop before
    starting on restart.
  * fixed restart script again. this time with better shell-fu

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * Just made a bunch of UI tweaks for dialog windows so they look
    nicer. Fixed a bug where opening 'Manual Date Range'/'Xref Counters'
    and then opening another dialog would use the wrong controls,
    instead of switching windows properly.
  * Giving more human-readable, descriptive names to the Edit menu
    items.
  * Commiting a small change to error cases in Custom date/Custom graph
    size dialogs, so that the user can edit what they've previously
    typed and correct it
  * Fix the login form so it doesn't look wierd when you resize the
    sidebar.
  * Prevented a graph.js concurrency issue that occurred when the events
    for redrawing a graph (in response to a reload) and toggling the
    series in a graph were interleaved. It would render something that
    was in the graph's series (because toggles affect the series
    instantly), but which wasn't loaded yet. Now redraws are given the
    series from their resepective reload, rather than relying on the
    current state. There is more work to be done though, because there
    are *still* problems if the requests come back out of order.

  [ Mitch Nibbelink ]
  * Fix bug where istatd agent crashes when its sent an event ... agents
    still do not propogate events upstream to the master, but at least

  [ Andrew Crowell ]
  * The login is now on the sidebar, and differently styled, as per
    design. Also fixing a bunch of login functionality things: Cookies
    are now off of the '/' path, so that '/?f=index.html' and
    '/files/index.html' share a common cookie. Fixed logout to expire
    the cookies reliably. Fixed login to search the entire cookie for a
    'login' key instead of the first value, because in some browsers
    there are other cookie entries (presumably because they don't
    isolate cookie entries by port).
  * The toolbar is now always visible, even when logged out. (Save
    Dashboard button is disabled when not logged in)
  * Animated the login state switch, and added placeholder
    'Username'/'*******' text for login inputs.
  * <div class='graph'> containers no longer have a fixed height, so the
    legend can wrap across multiple lines when needed. The graph grid
    layout still generally works, and so does graph canvas resizing.
  * Prevent the web interface from rendering graphs before there is
    data. Now dashboards will no longer trigger errors by redrawing
    before the graphs are initialized.

  * Moved the progress bar under the title. Made the chart size dropdown
    look like the design (except the icon).
  * Make the progress bar only show when something is loading. Also
    replace a tdurp with tdropdown so the chart size menu is no longer
    selectable as text.
  * The slider code no longer fires actions when its value is unchanged.
  * istatd web frontend now mostly works in IE9, but linear gradients
    mixed with border-radius doesn't work in IE, because of some
    limitations with IE's directx filter transform magic. Also context
    for exceptions in IE is sort of terrible. But there's not much I can
    do there.
  * Added a knob image for the slider widget, and a little arrow for the
    dropdown widget.

  [ Jon Watte ]
  * Allow older data, as long as it's not before the start of the file.
  * IE9 wants images in directories, not as query arguments. Make any
